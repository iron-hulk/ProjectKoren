# KOREN Mobile Agent
The Idea behind project Koren is to build a Context aware and reactive mobile agent. This fits into a larger ecosystem of technologies to be used to better my life.

To break it down essentially I want my device to become more intelligent, using it to aggregate information -> send it off to a central repo to process -> learn from it -> use it to handle events in my life more intelligently.

In my everyday life I would like it to handle logical situations like I am in a meeting and a call comes through, what should my device do. 

I will build out a list of features I would like the agent to handle and learn about.

Devices Events To Handle:

1- Phone Calls
2- Application Notifications
3- Device Notifications

Things to Learn About Me:

1- Device Usage
2- Daily habbits and patterns off device

Things to recommend to Me:

1- Optimised usage of device
2- Recommendations based on upcoming things(Charge battery because planning a long trip, wish someone for birthday)

Essentialy I would like a smart agent to make my mobile device smarter
